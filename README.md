# Germany National (Employment) Visa FAQs :india: :de: 

_Last Updated Date - 16th November 2018_

I see a lot of repeated queries related to Employment Visa every day in different Facebook groups, Linkedin etc which I thought can be put together at a single place so that it can benefit people who are looking for some information. This document is mainly for employment visa, but I will also include few common questions related to **family re-union** visa as well.

> Note - I will try to keep the information updated as much as I can, but I'll be happy to accept changes and contributions to this repository if you feel any information is wrong and should be updated.


### 1. How do I book an appointment for Employment Visa ?

[Visa appointment](https://india.diplo.de/in-en/service/05-VisaEinreise/-/1987006) can be booked online for all the consulate except Mumbai consulate. For Mumbai consulate, the only way to book an appointment is through calling the [VFS Mumbai](http://www.vfs-germany.co.in/mumbai/index.html) helpline number.

### 2. I do not find any open appointment slots for the next two months. What should I do ?

Almost all the applicants, apart from few lucky ones will face this situation as there is always a waiting time for more than a month ( sometimes couple of months ) for getting appointment slot. In such a case, what I will suggest is to grab the appointment slot you are getting initially even if its two months down the line. Then, prepare all your documents ( except the Demand Draft ) and keep them ready. Now, you can keep calling/checking online multiple times a day for any cancelled slots. For VFS Mumbai, you can call VFS in morning at 8:00 AM. And for other consulates, the best time to check online is between 3:30 AM - 4:30 AM IST for cancelled slots. If you are lucky, you might get the slot for the very next day.

### 3. Should I fill the visa application form online or manually by pen ?

Since you need to submit two identical application sets to the consulate, I will recommend filling the [form](https://india.diplo.de/blob/1822264/d317e8941e42d93fea294b3d12b05180/antrag-national-data.pdf) online ( it's an editable pdf ), and then take two printouts. This way, there are less chances of making a mistake.

### 4. What are the visa fees ?

You can find the latest visa fees on [this link](https://india.diplo.de/in-en/service/-/1987084). Since the EURO/INR exchange rate keeps changing, the visa fees can change accordingly. It is advisable to prepare the DD couple of days before your interview date after checking on the above link.

### 5. Can I submit DD from ICICI/HDFC bank ?

Yes, you can. The visa checklist says that DD should be from a nationalized bank only, which creates a confusion and people think that DD can be issued by banks like SBI, Union Bank only which is not true. Even I submitted a DD from ICICI and it worked.

### 6. From where can I buy the health insurance ?

I would recommend buying it from [Policy Bazaar](https://travel.policybazaar.com/) as you can compare various insurance providers ( check which ones are supported from [here](https://india.diplo.de/blob/1988500/cc58ff2d4af2e57febaf65788167a530/overseas-medical-insurance-data.pdf) ) and select the best. Note that the duration should be 180 days and minimum cover 50k USD.

### 7. I took health insurance for 1/3 months, but the visa approval mail says that it should be for 6 months. Will it create any problem in stamping ?

If they say 6 months, take for 6 months only :smile: Your visa stamping might get delayed ( as they might ask later for submitting 6 months insurance ) if you submit insurance of less duration.
