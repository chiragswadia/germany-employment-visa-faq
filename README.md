# Germany National Visa FAQs :india: :de: 

_Last Updated Date - 18th November 2018_

I see a lot of repeated queries related to Employment Visa every day in different Facebook groups, Linkedin etc which I thought can be put together at a single place so that it can benefit people who are looking for some information. This document is mainly for employment visa, but I will also include few common questions related to **family re-union** visa as well.

> Note - I will try to keep the information updated as much as I can, but I'll be happy to accept changes and contributions to this repository if you feel any information is wrong and should be updated.

## Employment Visa

### 1. How do I book an appointment for Employment Visa ?

[Visa appointment](https://india.diplo.de/in-en/service/05-VisaEinreise/-/1987006) can be booked online for all the consulate except Mumbai consulate. For Mumbai consulate, the only way to book an appointment is through calling the [VFS Mumbai](http://www.vfs-germany.co.in/mumbai/index.html) helpline number.


### 2. I do not find any open appointment slots for the next two months. What should I do ?

Almost all the applicants, apart from few lucky ones will face this situation as there is always a waiting time for more than a month ( sometimes couple of months ) for getting appointment slot. In such a case, what I will suggest is to grab the appointment slot you are getting initially even if its two months down the line. Then, prepare all your documents ( except the Demand Draft ) and keep them ready. Now, you can keep calling/checking online multiple times a day for any cancelled slots. For VFS Mumbai, you can call VFS in morning at 8:00 AM. And for other consulates, the best time to check online is between 3:30 AM - 4:30 AM IST for cancelled slots. If you are lucky, you might get the slot for the very next day.


### 3. Should I fill the visa application form online or manually by pen ?

Since you need to submit two identical application sets to the consulate, I will recommend filling the [form](https://india.diplo.de/blob/1822264/d317e8941e42d93fea294b3d12b05180/antrag-national-data.pdf) online ( it's an editable pdf ), and then take two printouts. This way, there are less chances of making a mistake.


### 4. What are the visa fees ?

You can find the latest visa fees on [this link](https://india.diplo.de/in-en/service/-/1987084). Since the EURO/INR exchange rate keeps changing, the visa fees can change accordingly. It is advisable to prepare the DD couple of days before your interview date after checking on the above link.


### 5. Can I submit DD from ICICI/HDFC bank ?

Yes, you can. The visa checklist says that DD should be from a nationalized bank only, which creates a confusion and people think that DD can be issued by banks like SBI, Union Bank only which is not true. Even I submitted a DD from ICICI and it worked.


### 6. From where can I buy the health insurance ?

I would recommend buying it from [Policy Bazaar](https://travel.policybazaar.com/) as you can compare various insurance providers ( check which ones are supported from [here](https://india.diplo.de/blob/1988500/cc58ff2d4af2e57febaf65788167a530/overseas-medical-insurance-data.pdf) ) and select the best. Note that the duration should be 180 days and minimum cover 50k USD.


### 7. I took health insurance for 1/3 months, but the visa approval mail says that it should be for 6 months. Will it create any problem in stamping ?

If they say 6 months, take for 6 months only :smile: Your visa stamping might get delayed ( as they might ask later for submitting 6 months insurance ) if you submit insurance of less duration.


### 8. I have all the documents ready except Deputation order from my current employer as I have not put my paper. What should I do in this case ?

Deputation order is only required if you are moving within the same company to Germany. For new offer, only work contract is sufficient.


### 9. Do I need to show proof of accommodation for employment visa application ?

For employment visa, no proof of accommodation is required at any stage. You can just mention your office address in the application form.


### 10. Is there any way to find the status of my visa application ?

Unfortunately, No. :sweat: If you call VFS, they will say that application is pending with the consulate. And if you call the consulate ( if your call gets connected ), then they will either ask you to wait for the update through e-mail, or they will say that application is pending with the foreigners office in Germany. So the only option left for you is to wait for the email from the consulate.


### 11. I got an email from consulate saying "Your application has been decided upon. Please collect your passport". What does this mean ?

In 95% of the cases, this means that your visa has been stamped on the passport. Congrats! :de:


## Dependent / Family Re-Union Visa

*main applicant in the below answers means the person who applied for employment visa or is already living in germany on work permit / blue card

### 1. What is the difference between Dependent and Family-Reunion visa ?

This is one the most common question that comes to people's mind when they see these two different categories for booking an appointment slot for national visa, and also their slot availability are different. From what I understand, you need to book a slot for dependent visa when the main applicant has not moved ( or not already living ) to Germany, and you plan to travel together. Family Reunion is a case when the main applicant is already residing in Germany.
In addition to my above point regarding dependent visa, even if you are not planning to travel together ( for eg. Spouse will travel 1 month after the main applicant ), then in that case as well you'll need to book a slot for dependent visa.
Note - In any case, in the application form, there is on option for Dependent visa category, so you need to tick Family Re-Union.


### 2. How can I provide proof of accommodation / payslips for dependent visa interview if we are travelling together ?
This is not required when the main applicant has not moved to Germany. Only signed work contract is sufficient. In the application form, in the address section, you can write the Germany's office address.


### 3. Do I need to take the document verification DD along with the visa fees DD ?
The document checklist for the family re-union visa says that DD for document verification is also needed, but this is not the case. There is no need to take the verification fees DD in your first appointment. Marriage verification does not happen for everyone. If the consulate thinks that they need to verify the marriage, they will ask via email later for submitting the DD.

### 4. If there any way to avoid marriage verification ?
If the consulate thinks that they need to verify it, and you get an email asking for the DD, nothing can be done at this stage. But, before your first interview, I would recommend getting your marriage certificate [Apostiled](http://www.vfsattestation.com/attestation.asp) to strengthen your application. For this, you can contact any local agent in your city. For example, I got my marriage certificate apostiled through [PEC Attestation services](https://www.pecattestation.com/). It looks like they provide their services across India.
Secondly, Mumbai consulate mentions that you should carry your wedding album on the day of interview. I would recommend taking it for other consulates as well, in case they ask. This shows that your marriage rituals were actually performed.


### 5. How long will it take to get the visa approval ?
Honestly, nobody can answer this question. It depends on case to case basis, some get in within a week and for some it might take couple of months. However, if you are going to travel together, the consulate will try to approve the visa maybe couple of weeks before the intended travel date. But, in case when the main applicant is  already in Germany, it will take more time as verification is done in the local Rathaus as well.

### 6. Do I need to show proof of German knowledge ?
Not required if your spouse is a blue card holder or eligible for getting blue card.
